        Welcome to Department of Holistic Education
      </h1>

      <p className="text-justify text-black">
        To realize the vision of Bharat as a global superpower, we must build an education system rooted in Bharatiya values, powered by skill development, and committed to the holistic development of every learner. Education must transcend academic scores—it should engage the heart, mind, and hands, nurturing responsible citizens, innovative thinkers, and ethical leaders of tomorrow.

      <p className="text-justify text-black">
        Inspired by the transformative vision of Vidya Bharti, the Department of Holistic Education (DHE) was founded to serve as a driving force for educational reform and thought leadership in India. DHE functions as the intellectual and operational nerve center for:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-black">
        <li>Advancing educational discourse aligned with NEP 2020</li>
        <li>Organizing national initiatives like the Shiksha Mahakumbh Abhiyan</li>
        <li>Designing digital platforms and IT tools for efficient school management</li>
        <li>Enabling cross-disciplinary dialogue and leadership development</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p className="text-justify text-black">
        Founded in 2021 under Vidya Bharti Punjab, and later scaled nationally under the Vidya Bharti Institute of Training & Research (VBITR) Trust in 2023, DHE has quickly emerged as a respected and action-oriented platform. It has brought together a powerful ecosystem of educators, scientists, doctors, engineers, legal experts, social reformers, and more—working collectively to transform India’s educational landscape.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-justify text-black">
        At the helm of this initiative is Dr. Thakur S.K.R., a senior scientist at ISRO and a pioneer in educational experimentation. With a deep commitment to value-based, context-sensitive, and innovation-driven learning, Dr. Thakur envisions an education system that instills character, competence, and creativity in the next generation, while staying grounded in Indian civilizational ethos.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-justify text-black">
        Through the Shiksha Mahakumbh Abhiyan, DHE has created a dynamic, inclusive platform that brings together stakeholders from all walks of life to discuss, innovate, and act on pressing educational challenges. It is not merely a series of events—but a national movement for educational transformation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-justify text-black">
        DHE is also leading the development of impact-focused platforms to bring innovation into daily practice:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-black">
        <li>Tredul – Transforming tourism for modern classrooms</li>
        <li>Sarvatra – A unified school resource and data management system</li>
        <li>Swadeshi Bazaar – Promoting local innovation and entrepreneurship</li>
        <li>Jobs 360° – Career readiness and employment ecosystem for school system</li>
        <li>TuDu – Event management platform</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p className="text-justify text-black">
        To ensure that the ideas and strategies emerging from these initiatives reach both society and policymakers, DHE publishes two quarterly journals:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-black">
        <li>Viksit Bharat</li>
        <li>Viksit India</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p className="text-justify text-black">
        These publications curate cutting-edge ideas, success stories, and policy recommendations, reinforcing India’s journey towards becoming a Vishwa Guru through education.
