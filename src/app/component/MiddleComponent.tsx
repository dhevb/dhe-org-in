    The foundation of DHE is based on the ideology that the level of education should not be gauged by academic scores alone. Rather, in true essence, education should aim at holistic development of children and should be multi-disciplinary focusing on skill development, physical fitness, emotional well being and development of strong ethics in students. Holistic education will transform young minds into not only professionally skilled adults but also responsible individuals who are an asset for the nation.

    Keeping pace with the technology driven world, there is an imperative need of integration of technology with value-based education.
