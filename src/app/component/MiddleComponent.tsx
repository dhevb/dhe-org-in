        Though Vidya Bharti was formed with this intention only, the last
        decade driven by technology led us to think about the integration of
        technology with value-based education. Further, the problems arose in
        education in the last couple of decades shall be addressed in an
        effective way. With this intention, Department of Holistic Education was
        incepted in Sarvhitkari Educational Society, which is a State Unit of
        Vidya Bharti. At present, the Department has 25 Cells with dedicated
        coordinators to lead these cells. The in-depth research and development
        in each area are exhaustively done prior to run pilot projects and
        implementing them in schools and society.
