        Welcome to Department of Holistic Education
      </h1>

      <p className="text-justify text-black">
        The foundation of the Department of Holistic Education &#40;DHE&#41; is rooted
        in the ideology that education should extend beyond academic
        institutions. Vidya Bharti, the largest educational NGO globally,
        established a dedicated think tank Department comprising professionals
        from diverse fields such as academia, bureaucracy, higher and school
        education, society, scientists, and other experts like advocates and
        chartered accountants. DHE was conceptualized in 2021 by visionary ISRO
        scientist Dr Thakur SKR under the guidance of educationist and social
        reformer Shri Vijay Kumar Nadda, Organising Secretary, Vidya Bharti&#45;
        North Zine as a pilot project under Vidya Bharti Punjab. Recognizing its
        remarkable growth and contributions to education, it was elevated to an
        independent organization under the auspices of Vidya Bharti Institute of
        Training and Research Trust.

        Currently, DHE operates under the trust&apos;s umbrella. With 25 dedicated
        cells led by coordinators, DHE spearheads various initiatives aimed at
        transforming the education system. These include groundbreaking projects
        such as E&#45;cycle, Punjab Super 100, Tredul, Sarvatr, Holistic Harbour,
        PoojaWala, TuDu, Swadeshi Bazaar, Jobs360o. DHE has also revived the
        glorious saga of having dedicated Kumbh/Mahkumbh for each major issue of
        society prevailing in ancient Bharat by creating annual large scale
        events in the form of Shiksha Mahakumbh and Shiksha Kumbh, attracting
        dignitaries and stakeholders from diverse fields. Additionally, DHE laid
        foundation of a quarterly journal called 	&quot;Viksit India,&quot; covering a wide
        range of educational topics to make Bharat a self reliant hub in terms
        of educational and scientific publication. The Department comprises 310
        professionals from diverse backgrounds who are volunteering their
        service to shape the nation through education apart from 4 full&#45;time
        employees and 20 graduate engineerÂ trainees.
