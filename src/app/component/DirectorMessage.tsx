        Serving Society by Education is the Best Way of Serving the Nation. But
        what kind of education it should be is the most important aspect. In
        todayâ€™s era, on one side, the literacy rate is increasing, and on the
        other side, there is a huge increase in mental patients, disturbed
        families, violence, etc. Education should make a person more
        compassionate, accommodative, and social. However, things are happening
        just the opposite.

        Additionally, the scarcity of skilled workforce is all around. In this
        scenario, the holistic approach to mold a child right from his or her
        initial days is a must. Molding these green cakes should be in such a
        way that they not only become skilled individuals but also more
        compassionate, accommodative, and social. To inculcate this culture,
        Department of Holistic Education at Sarvhitkari Educational Society was
        conceptualized. I feel contented leading this futuristic Department and
        thrive to make a difference in school education and society.
